# Futur upgrade : 
- Base back-end functionality on 1/2. Send version A or version B every other time. For the moment, this is done randomly, but it allows you to have a working prototype.
- Unit testing of the A/B testing / Stats functionality

# Feature bonus : 
- Database recording of each version request (each entry on the site).
- BDD record for each funnel 100% complete
- A statistics function (currently log in the console), which provides a percentage conversion rate for each version.
